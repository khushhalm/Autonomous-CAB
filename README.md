# AutonoumsCAB

A self-driving car is a dream of millions. But instead of following a traditional path of using sophisticated algorithm is not what we have thought of following because any algorithm, developed till now, is not so good which can replace a human driver completely in the near future. So we have come with a novel Idea of using magnets to drive a car (autonomously). The road will be equipped with magnets and the car can navigate by itself with the help of the magnets and a hall sensor, which can detect the presence/absence of it. It also has an ultrasonic/proximity sensor so that it should not collide or bumps into some other car (an obstacle in general).

Step by Step Instructions:-
1. Assemble a normal chassis kit. (Attach 2 gear motors along with wheels and one universal wheel to the chassis)
2. Upload the code to the Arduino.
3. Assemble the hardware as shown in the schematic diagram.
4. Put the sensor on a long stick, so it can be a bit away from the chassis. (As the chassis is also made from iron so if this comes near to a magnet it'll attract it and it'll disturb our arrangement)
5. Arrange the magnets in two or more parallel line.
6. Start the cab by turning the power supply "On".
7. In the Keypad enter the route. And at last press "D" key. It acts like enter.

Instruction for entering route.</br>
First press direction letter and then number of magnets to be travelled.</br>
"F" for forward.</br>
"R" for Right.</br>
"L" for Left.</br>
1 to 9 Magnets to travel.</br>
Example: "F5R1" This will make the "CAB" to move 5 magnets forward and after that take a 90 degree turn to the right. (You can see this in the video)</br>
