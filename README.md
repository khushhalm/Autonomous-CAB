A self-driving car is a dream of millions. But instead of following a traditional path of using sophisticated algorithm is not what we have thought of following because any algorithm, developed till now, is not so good which can replace a human driver completely in the near future. So we have come with a novel Idea of using magnets to drive a car (autonomously). The road will be equipped with magnets and the car can navigate by itself with the help of the magnets and a hall sensor, which can detect the presence/absence of it. It also has an ultrasonic/proximity sensor so that it should not collide or bumps into some other car (an obstacle in general).
